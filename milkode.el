;; Command line search and direct jump with Milkode.
;; Milkode(http://milkode.ongaeshi.me) of the installation is required.

;; Feature
;;   1. Search (milkode:search). Jump to row C-c C-c.
;;   2. When you search for direct pass ('/path/to/dir:15') jump directly to the specified row.
;;   3. Move the cursor to direct pass on a text file, (milkode:search) can jump
;;
;; Displayed direct pass to click the line number in the 'milk web' (ex. http://kodeworld.ongaeshi.me/)
